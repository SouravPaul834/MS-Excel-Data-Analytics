# MS-Excel-Data-Analytics
I speak at conferences and conduct training on using MS Excel.

I frequently hear that “Excel is not a true data analytics tool…”, “there are other software applications that are so much better…”, “I want to learn, but I don’t have a data set to work with”.

Each of those statements is true. BUT, they usually are stated by someone that has not developed their Excel skills beyond the basic level, or their organization utilizes some of the more advanced tools, such as Tableau or Qlik (some do, many don’t).

Since I encounter this so frequently, I decided to post this. Why? Because going forward, it will save me the effort of providing my usual observations!
